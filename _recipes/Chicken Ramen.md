- 2 tbsp mirin (white wine vinegar or dry sherry will do if no Mirin)
- 4 cups rich chicken stock (1litre)
- 1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh) (1oz is 30g ish don't let this limit you, any mushroom will do but try go meaty mushroom)
- 1–2 tsp sea salt, to taste
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup scallions, sliced (spring onions it means spring onions about 2)

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
- Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper. 
- Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
- Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan,- about 5-7 minutes.
- Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
- Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
- Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.

- fill a  large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the - cooking process. 
- Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in - half, lengthwise.
