ingredients:
- 1/2 tsp dried chilli flakes
- 2 plant-based brioche buns
- 50g lamb's lettuce
- 80g coconut yoghurt
- 1 pot of mint sauce (20g)
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 15g fresh root ginger
- 3 white potatoes
- 2 brown onions
- 1/2 cucumber
- 10g coriander
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 pot of mango chutney (20g)
- 4 tbsp cornflour


directions:
- Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7
- Cut the potatoes (skins on) into thin chips, then add them to a baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt
- Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until crisp
- peel and finely slice the brown onions (as finely as you can!)
- Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger
- Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic
- Chop the coriander roughly (including the stalks)
- Add 60g [120g] flour to a large bowl along with the cornflour, curry powder and a generous pinch of salt
- Add 100ml [200ml] cold water and mix thoroughly to a smooth, thick batter – this is your spiced batter
- Add the sliced onion, chopped coriander, ginger and garlic to the bowl with the spiced batter and gently mix until all of the onion is coated – this is your onion bhaji mixture
- Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to fully coat the bottom of the pan) over a high heat
- Once very hot, add 4 large spoonfuls of the onion bhaji mixture to separate areas of the pan and press them down with the back of a spoon to flatten them into patties
- Cook for 3-4 min on each side until crispy and golden
- Once golden and cooked through, add the patties to a plate and set aside – these are your onion bhaji patties
- While the patties are cooking, grate half the cucumber and dice the rest
- Add the grated cucumber to a bowl with the coconut yoghurt, mint sauce and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your coconut raita
- Wash the lamb's lettuce and dry it with kitchen paper
- Then add it to a bowl with the diced cucumber and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your cucumber salad
- Once the chips are almost done, remove the tray from the oven and sprinkle over the chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) – these are your chilli chips
- Slice the plant-based brioche buns in half, add them to the tray with the chips and return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min until the brioche is warmed through
- Spread a dollop of mint raita on the base of each warmed brioche bun
- Stack them up with the onion bhaji patties, mango chutney, cucumber salad and more coconut raita
- Serve the chilli chips and any remaining cucumber salad to the side
