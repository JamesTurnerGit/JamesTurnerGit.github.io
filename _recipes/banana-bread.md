ingredients:
- 2 tbsp	Extra virgin olive oil	
- 2 tbsp	Unsalted butter	
- 1 medium sized	Onion	Finely diced
- 2 cloves	Garlic	Minced or grated
- ½ tsp	Dried oregano	
- Pinch	Red pepper flakes	
- 28 oz / 830ml can	Whole tomatoes in juice	Crushed by hand or potato masher into ½ inch chunks
- 1 stem	Fresh basil	optional
- ½ cup	Heavy cream	
- ¼ cup	Vodka	
- (Kosher) salt	
- 1lb / 450g	Penne, ziti, or other short tubular pasta	
- 1lb / 450g	Chicken breasts	Cut into ½ inch wide slivers
- 2 tbsp	Fresh parsley	Chopped
- Parmigiano Reggiano	Grated, for serving

directions:
- Heat the olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until the butter has melted and the foaming subsides. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic,    oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, with their juice, and basil if using. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and reduced to 4 cups, about 30 minutes.	
- Transfer the sauce to the jar of a blender, discarding the basil, and add the cream and vodka. Starting on the lowest speed and gradually increasing to high, blend until completely smooth, about 30 seconds. Return to the sacepan and bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce to a bare simmer and allow to reduce further while the pasta cooks.	
- Place the pasta in a large pot and cover with hot water. Add a large pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking. Continue to cook until the pasta is fully softened but retains a slight bite in the center. Meanwhile about 2 minutes before the pasta is done, add the chicken to the sauce and stir to combine.	
- Drain the pasta, reserving 1½ cups of the cooking liquid, and return to the pot. Add the sauce, stir to combine, and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has achieved the desired consistency, about 1 minute, adding some of the reserved pasta water as necessary. Serve immediately, topped with the parsley and grated cheese.
